    "Clusters are evaluated based on some similarity or dissimilarity measure such as the distance between cluster points. If the clustering algorithm separates dissimilar observations apart and similar observations together, then it has performed well.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- To study the separation distance between the clusters formed by the algorithm silhouette analysis could be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The distance between the cluster can be calculated by different types of distance metrics ( Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski, Hamming). Silhouette score returns the average silhouette coefficient applied on all the samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The silhouette value is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). The silhouette ranges from −1 to +1, where a high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters. If most objects have a high value, then the clustering configuration is appropriate. If many points have a low or negative value, then the clustering configuration may have too many or too few clusters.\n",
