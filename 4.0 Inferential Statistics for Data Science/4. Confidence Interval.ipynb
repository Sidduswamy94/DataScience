    "## Confidence Interval :\n",
    "- The confidence interval is the range of values that you expect your estimate to fall between a certain percentage of the time if you run your experiment again or re-sample the population in the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The confidence level is the percentage of times you expect to reproduce an estimate between the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval, and is set by the alpha value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**For example**\n",
    "- If you construct a confidence interval with a 95% confidence level, you are confident that 95 out of 100 times the estimate will fall between the upper and lower values specified by the confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your desired confidence level is usually one minus the alpha (α) value you used in your statistical test :\n",
    "\n",
    "        Confidence level = 1 − a\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- So if you use an alpha value of p < 0.05 for statistical significance, then your confidence level would be 1 − 0.05 = 0.95, or 95%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why we use Confidence Interval :\n",
    "- Instead of predicting with a single value, we will predict with interval because, the probability of the single value=0, whereas probability for interval is some value (not zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### If we want to calculate a confidence interval on our own, we need to know :\n",
    "\n",
    "       1) The point estimate you are constructing the confidence interval for.\n",
    "       2) The critical values for the test statistic.\n",
    "       3) The standard deviation of the sample.\n",
    "       4) The sample size.\n",
    "       \n",
    "       \n",
    "### 1) Point estimate :\n",
    "- The point estimate of your confidence interval will be whatever statistical estimate you are making (e.g., population mean, the difference between population means, proportions, variation among groups).\n",
    "    \n",
    " \n",
    "<b> Example : \n",
    "- In the TV-watching example, the point estimate is the mean number of hours watched: 35.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### 2) Finding the critical value :\n",
    "- Critical values tell you how many standard deviations away from the mean you need to go in order to reach the desired confidence level for your confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "- There are three steps to find the critical value.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "<b> 1. Choose your alpha (α) value.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The alpha value is the probability threshold for statistical significance. The most common alpha value is p = 0.05, but 0.1, 0.01, and even 0.001 are sometimes used. It’s best to look at the research papers published in your field to decide which alpha value to use.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "<b> 2. Decide if you need a one-tailed interval or a two-tailed interval.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- You will most likely use a two-tailed interval unless you are doing a one-tailed t test. For a two-tailed interval, divide your alpha by two to get the alpha value for the upper and lower tails.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "<b> 3. Look up the critical value that corresponds with the alpha value.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- If your data follows a normal distribution, or if you have a large sample size (n > 30) that is approximately normally distributed, you can use the z distribution to find your critical values.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- If you are using a small dataset (n ≤ 30) that is approximately normally distributed, use the t distribution instead.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- The t distribution follows the same shape as the z distribution, but corrects for small sample sizes. For the t distribution, you need to know your degrees of freedom (sample size minus 1).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### 3. Finding the standard deviation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Most statistical software will have a built-in function to calculate your standard deviation, but to find it by hand you can first find your sample variance, then take the square root to get the standard deviation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "<b> 1. Find the sample variance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Sample variance is defined as the sum of squared differences from the mean, also known as the mean-squared-error (MSE):\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "                       ∑ (x - x̅)**2\n",
    "             S^2 =  ------------------\n",
    "                          n - 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "- To find the MSE, subtract your sample mean from each value in the dataset, square the resulting number, and divide that number by n − 1 (sample size minus 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Then add up all of these numbers to get your total sample variance (s2).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "<b> 2. Find the standard deviation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The standard deviation of your estimate (s) is equal to the square root of the sample variance/sample error (s2):\n",
    "\n",
    "            s = √ s^2    \n",
    " \n",
    "    \n",
    "### 4. Sample size.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The sample size is the number of observations in your data set."
