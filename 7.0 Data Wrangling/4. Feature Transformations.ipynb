    "## Feature Transformation :\n",
    "- Feature transformation is a mathematical transformation in which we apply a mathematical formula to a particular column (feature) and transform the values, which are useful for our further analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is a technique by which we can boost our model performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is also known as Feature Engineering, which creates new features from existing features that may help improve the model performance.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "## Reasons for using transformations :\n",
    "- Convenience: A transformed scale may be as natural as the original scale and more convenient for a specific purpose (e.g. \n",
    "  percentages rather than original data, sines rather than degrees). One important example is standardization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reducing skewness: A transformation may be used to reduce skewness. A distribution that is symmetric or nearly so is often   \n",
    "  easier to handle and interpret than a skewed distribution. To reduce right skewness, take roots or logarithms or reciprocals \n",
    "  (roots are weakest). This is the commonest problem in practice. To reduce left skewness, take squares or cubes or higher \n",
    "  powers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Equal spreads: A transformation may be used to produce approximately equal spreads, despite marked variations in level, which \n",
    "  again makes data easier to handle and interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear relationships: When looking at relationships between variables, it is often far easier to think about patterns that \n",
    "  are approximately linear than about patterns that are highly curved.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Additive relationships: Relationships are often easier to analyse when additive rather than multiplicative.\n"
